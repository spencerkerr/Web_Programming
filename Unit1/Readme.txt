Why our project is worth 100 points:
	It has kittens!!! It is a great Sudoku game where the numbers are represented by the number of kittens shown in the picture.
	Almost all of it is written using javascript.
CSS3 Features:
	outline-offset: gives an outline past the border of an object without 'using up' the space it occupies.
	canvas animation: moves our canvas header back and forth
	gradient color on canvas: makes the canvas header more appealing

Difficult to implement:
	loop to draw table
	updating current state of board.
